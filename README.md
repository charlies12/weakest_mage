Exploring web scraping.
Currently it shows chapter title and number. As well as the URL and when the chapter was posted.
Next, I want to align the text in the columns to the left and expand the column width.
Eventually, I would like to run the script once every hour, even when my computer is off. 
I have an idea on how to start it, but it's something new to me.
Also would like to get an email notification when a new chapter is released.
